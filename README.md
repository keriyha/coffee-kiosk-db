☕ CoffeeKiosk — SQL Project

A simple, real-world SQL Server project that simulates how a small coffee shop runs its orders and payments.

I built this project to practice clean database design, real POS logic, and business analytics not just queries, but how data actually flows in production.

What’s inside

A full coffee shop database (customers, products, orders, payments)

A stored procedure to place multi-item orders like a real POS system

Analytics views for sales, top products, margins, and customer value

Data quality checks to catch missing payments, bad prices, or broken data

Why this project

This project shows how I think about:

Data integrity (keys, constraints, validations)

Business logic in SQL (not just SELECTs)

Analytics readiness (views built for dashboards like Power BI)
